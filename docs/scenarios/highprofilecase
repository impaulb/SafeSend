Sarah Reynolds is involved in 3 overlapping cases at one time. One of her clients is a popular singer facing tax fraud charges in one of the highest profile cases that her firm has taken on in the last 5 years. Sarah’s boss has trusted her with this case. However, Sarah also has 2 other open cases going to trial next week. Although Sarah is a veteran legal counsel with over 15 years of experience and is well-known for her attention to detail, she wants to mitigate the possible risks of accidentally disclosing sensitive information in her emails. Because of the overlapping cases, she also worries that she may mix up her clients’ data when communicating with them. Sarah needs a system that monitors sensitive information that she may miss or forget to remove in her emails. 

Manual detection of sensitive information isn’t something that Sarah can rely on during this stressful week, so she researches methods to automatically ensure client privacy and confidentiality in her day-to-day communication. She comes across the Gmail plugin SafeSend, which scans her emails as she types. Sarah adds SafeSend as an add-on to her Gmail account and selects the option to dynamically warn her when she types sensitive client information in her emails. The system catches Sarah typing the high-profile client’s SSN in an email to the wrong recipient and highlights the number with a warning message, which she then catches and deletes.
