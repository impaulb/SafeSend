Alex Chen is known for his high regard for data privacy in his Human Resources position. However, that wasn’t always the case in his early career. This week, his company announced that they will be doing a review of data privacy and security across the entire organization. Alex worries that his old emails contained sensitive information that wasn’t hidden, redacted or deleted properly. 

Alex, as someone who now looks out for ways to increase security in his email communications, hears about the Gmail plugin SafeSend. In a quick 2-step process, Alex adds SafeSend as an add-on to his Gmail account. Alex selects the option to scan all emails in his inbox for sensitive information and comes across old emails that include employee SSNs, salaries and other personal information. The system highlights these and gives him the option to keep, redact or delete those parts of his emails. Alex selects the option to delete the sensitive information. He secures the privacy of his colleague’s information and passes the company’s organization-wide security review.
