As a financial analyst for a large bank, Lisa Thompson has to forward hundreds of emails a day between clients and other analysts on her team. While Lisa knows the importance of protecting sensitive financial information in email communications and takes great care in making sure she does so, her clients often send private information through emails. 

This week, Lisa’s boss has tasked her with directing clients to more specialized analysts for their investments. In order to maximize efficiency, Lisa needs to be able to filter and forward emails from clients to her colleagues quickly. Lisa adds the Gmail plugin SafeSend to her Gmail account to facilitate this process. Lisa has selected the options to automatically redact sensitive client information in any of the emails she receives. Now, Lisa forwards client emails to her colleagues without worrying about reading through and manually filtering each message, getting the work done two days before her boss’ deadline
